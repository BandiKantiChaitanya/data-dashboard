# No-Code Collaborative Dashboard Builder
This is a no-code, collaborative dashboard builder inspired by platforms like Retool and Metabase. Users can create and customize visual widgets (bar charts, line charts, curved charts, etc.) using a schema-driven system. The dashboard supports dynamic theming (light/dark), drag-and-drop positioning, and widget resizing. Each widget's configuration — including type, data, layout, and style — is saved in a backend powered by Node.js and MongoDB. The app includes a component-based canvas layout, allowing flexible arrangement of widgets, and is designed to help non-technical users visualize data with ease.

## How to Use
**Create a Chart** : Click the "Add Charts" button and fill out the form to create a new chart.

**Resize and Drag**: After adding a chart, you can drag and resize it on the dashboard to customize your layout. Please do this carefully to avoid overlapping or layout issues.

**Dynamic Theming**: Use the theme switch toggle to switch between light and dark modes.
